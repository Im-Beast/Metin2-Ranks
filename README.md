# Metin2-Ranks

Spigot plugin which adds Metin2 Rank system to the game. It is very simple plugin made because of one request. It doesn't include any configs or supporting any apis.
In the future i'll maybe take a try to make it better and with more posibilities to change.

* adds:
 - nametag above your head which shows ur current rank
 - all metin2 ranks:
   - Chivalric  [>8 points]
   - Noble	    [>6 points]
   - Good	      [>4 points]
   - Friendly	  [>2 points]
   - Neutral	  [<2/>-2 points]
   - Aggressive	[<-2 points]
   - Fraudulent	[<-4 points]
   - Malicious	[<-6 points]
   - Cruel	    [<-8 points]

 * gain points by:
   - killing hostile monsters
   - killing people with negative ranks whilist having positive or neutral rank
   - eating gapple/enchanted gapple (work as zen bean from metin, works only if you have minus points)
   - beating ender dragon and wither
  * loose points by:
   - killing friendly monsters [excluding food sources like cow or sheep]
   - killing people which ranks are positive or neutral

 * if you're playing with keepInventory set to true people which have negative ranks have chance to loose some of their items. Cruel can loose up to 4 items with 40% chance each.
